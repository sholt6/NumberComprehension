# NumberComprehension

Uses text-to-speech and random number generation to help you practice number comprehension in a range of languages

As a language learner, I noticed that while I know all the words for numbers in my target language, decoding them and identifying the number in the concept of natural spoken language is a real challenge.
I created this app to allow me to practice this skill in isolation whenever I want.
